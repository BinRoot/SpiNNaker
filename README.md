# SpiNNaker Projects


Here are some pieces of code that run on the SpiNNaker, a Spiking Neural Network Architecture inspired by the human brain. 

## Running Code
Each directory should contain a `build.sh` script, `Makefile`, and `[app_name].c` code. Just run the build script in each directory with spinnaker_tools installed: `./build` and you're ready to go.
